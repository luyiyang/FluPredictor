Project Description: 	
	Prior scholars have done a couple of researches on the potential of social media in prediction of disease outbreak. In this project, we build a disease predictive system based on Twitter. Our prediction system will send an alert to users when it is likely to be an outbreak of flu. 
	Before getting the results of flu, a user must select a location. (See User Manual for more detailed instructions).
